other value
we will choose the commonly used values T = 5, R = 3, P = 1, and S = 0.

(1) Tit-for-tat: cooperate on the ﬁrst move, and play the opponents previous move after that;
(2) Grim: cooperate on the ﬁrst move, and keep cooperating unless the opponent defects, in which case, defect forever;
(3) Pavlov: cooperate on the ﬁrst move, and on subsequent moves, switch strategies if you were punished on the previous move

The Nash equilibrium solution for a two player zero-sum problem
can be easily obtained as a solution to a convex optimization
problem. We consider a problem of an iterated zero-sum game


Defect or Cooperate


?

CC - R: Reward 3
CD - S: Sucker 0
DC - T: Temptation 5
DD - P: Penalty 1

T > R > P > S
(T+S)/2 < R


Why dilemna

// we say "move" for iterative game ?
The number of moves should not be known to the two palers
The winner is the player with the highest score in the end
Usually, there are many players :
	Round Robin Tournament ??

!!
Non zero Sum Game
	Both the players can simultaneously win or lose !!
 	=> but you can make a version of it

No universal best strategy
	depends upon the opponents
